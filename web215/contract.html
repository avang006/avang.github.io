<h2>Course Contract</h2>
<div class="info">I, Alyssa Vang agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING 2024 WEB215-N801 ADVANCED WEB MARKEUP & SCRIPTING with my instructor, Professor D.I. Von Briesen.</p>

<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>

<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>

<p>Signed: Alyssa Vang, 14/01/2024</p></div></div>
