      <h2>Contract</h2>
               <p>I, <a href="introduction.html" id="namelink">Alyssa Vang</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my FALL 2024 WEB250-N801 DATABASE DRIVEN WEBSITES with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
               <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private</p>
               <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
               <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
               <p>Signed: <span class="style">Alyssa Vang, 21/08/2024</span></p>
