<p>I, <a href="introduction.html" id="namelink">Alyssa Vang</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SPRING 2024 WEB215-N801 ADVANCED WEB MARKUP & SCRIPTING with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

Signed: <span class="style">Alyssa Vang, 14/01/2024</span></p></div></main>
